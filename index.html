  <h2><span class="aboutme">A little about me...</span></h2>
<div class="well">
  <p>I was born in Corpus Cristi, TX and raised in San Diego, CA. After graduating High School, I moved to Seattle, WA - a brand new city where I knew no one. I was
  not a fan of the rainy city. I wanted to return to the nice and sunny San Diego city as soon as I arrived but as months passed, I learned to love the city and have
  been living in WA for 10 years.</p>

  <p>I recently resigned from my job and decided to have a change of career. Previously, I was a Senior Implementation Consultant at CDK Global. I worked
  with many developers in the industry to why I decided to pursue my education in programming.

  <p>My goal is to travel and work anywhere in the world.</p>

<p><span class="quote">Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.
 And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.
 As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. Steve Jobs </span></p>
