  <h1><span class="aboutme">A little about me...</span></h1>

    <p>I was born in Corpus Cristi, TX and raised in San Diego, CA. After graduating High School, I moved to Seattle, WA - a brand new city where I knew no one. I was
  not a fan of the rainy city. I wanted to return to the nice and sunny San Diego city as soon as I arrived but as months passed, I learned to love the city and have
  been living in WA for 10 years.</p>

    <p>I recently resigned from my job and decided to have a change of career. Previously, I was a Senior Implementation Consultant at CDK Global. I worked
  with many developers in the industry to why I decided to pursue my education in programming.

    <p>My goal is to travel and work anywhere in the world.</p>
